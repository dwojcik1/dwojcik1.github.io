I am currently a PhD Candidate at the Space Research Centre of Polish Academy of Sciences (CBK PAN) in Warsaw, Poland, working under supervision of Prof. Wiesław M. Macek. 
My education and research has covered various areas, including mathematical modeling in cyber insurance and economy, as well as the study of generalized Lorenz equations in physics.
Recently, I have been focusing on stochastic processes, particularly Markov processes, ordinary and stochastic differential equations, statistical methods and numerical analyses (using R, Python, and Matlab languages), and finally fractal / multifractal theory.
My other recent research interests include solar wind, turbulence, space plasmas, kinetic scales, and data analysis.
This multidisciplinary background has given me the flexibility to adapt to new research areas easier, and I always welcome new challenges. I am eager to explore new scientific fields, and I believe my open-minded approach would allow me to contribute to collaborative research projects.

I hold B.Sc. in Mathematics (Finances), and two M.Sc.'s in Mathematics in Economy, and Insurance & Finance respectively. I also take part in a National Science Centre project on Turbulence and Magnetic Reconnection in Earth’s Space Environment. 

This website is my personal space where you can find information related to my research and fields of interest. Besides mathematics and programming, I like to spend my time on reading books, cooking, playing strategy games, and taking care of my family. I'd like to hear from people if they have any query, advice, or a job.

You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
