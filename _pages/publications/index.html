In our previous studies, we have shown that solar wind turbulence in the inertial range of large magnetohydrodynamic scales exhibits Markov properties. We have recently extended this approach on much smaller kinetic scales. Here we are testing for the Markovian character of stochastic processes in a kinetic regime based on magnetic field and velocity fluctuations in the solar wind, measured onboard the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission: behind the bow shock, inside the magnetosheath, and near the magnetopause. We have verified that the Chapman-Kolmogorov necessary conditions for Markov processes is satisfied for local transfer of energy between the magnetic and velocity fields also on kinetic scales. We have confirmed that for magnetic fluctuations, the first Kramers-Moyal coefficient is linear, while the second term is quadratic, corresponding to drift and diffusion processes in the resulting Fokker-Planck equation. It means that magnetic self-similar turbulence is described by generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. We show that for the magnetic case, the Fokker-Planck equation leads to the probability density functions of the kappa distributions, which exhibit global universal scale invariance with a linear scaling and lack of intermittency. On the contrary, for velocity fluctuations, higher order Kramers-Moyal coefficients should be taken into account and hence scale invariance is not observed. However, the nonextensity parameter in Tsallis entropy provides a robust measure of the departure of the system from equilibrium. The obtained results are important for a better understanding of the physical mechanism governing turbulent systems in space and laboratory.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">PRE</span><span class="p">,</span>

Building upon prior Markovian analysis of turbulence of the transfer of magnetic-to-magnetic field fluctuations in the near-Earth space environment [10.1093/mnras/stad2584, 10.3847/1538-4357/aca0a0], we also extend our investigation to ion velocity-to-velocity and magnetic-to-velocity cases. However, we direct our focus towards the purer statistical facet of the analysis, joint with the elements of dynamical approach. We analyze whether the transfer of increments exhibits ‘local‘ or ‘non-local‘ character, which in this context, they describe the scales involved in interactions that lead to the turbulent cascade. Additionally, we observe a global scale-invariance in relation to the Fokker-Planck equation, for a magnetic field case. Finally, we briefly discuss a potential non-parametric approach, namely a stochastic dynamical jump-diffusion model, or alternatively a multi-fractal approach, which can be useful to describe the underlying process accurately. We believe that such a comparative approach spanning diverse conditions is meaningful, as it aims to unveil any underlying universality within the statistical properties of the near-Earth solar wind space plasma at the intricate kinetic and sub-ion scales.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">EGU24</span><span class="p">,</span>

Various fractal scaling models of the large-scale mass distribution have already been proposed. The expected universal multifractal function for galaxies is similar to that identi ed by NASA’s Voyager mission in the Solar System. Hence we now apply the similar method for determination of the reliable multifractal spectrum of distribution of galaxies on cosmological scales, based on selected observations from a million of galaxies in the Redshift Catalog updated in June 2008. We show that the observed spectrum is consistent with the weighted one- or two-scale Cantor set models characteristic for turbulence in laboratory and inside the Sun’s heliosphere immersed in the very local interstellar medium. However, the total degree of multifractality Delta=0.2 is smaller than that inside the heliosphere. This would be characteristic for a simple linear fractal scaling of galaxy distribution, but somewhat varying for nearby (Delta=0.1) and the most remote galaxies (Delta=0.2) receding from our Solar System. The parameters p=0.45 and lambda&lt;=1/2 for one-scale model are apparently related to some voids in the large-scale distribution of matter. A possible asymmetry (A 3/4) of the total spectrum for the two-scale weighted Cantor set (A != 1) could admittedly be attributed to some deviations from the Hubble’s law for the ideal uniform expansion of the Universe.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">SN24</span><span class="p">,</span>

We apply the statistical analysis using a Fokker–Planck equation to investigate processes responsible for stochastic fluctuations in space plasmas. As already known, turbulence in the inertial range of hydromagnetic scales exhibits Markovian features. We have extended the statistical approach to much smaller scales in space, where kinetic theory should be applied. Here we study in detail and compare the characteristics of magnetic fluctuations behind the bow shock, inside the magnetosheath, and near the magnetopause. It appears that the first Kramers–Moyal coefficient is linear and the second term is a quadratic function of magnetic increments, which describe drift and diffusion, correspondingly, in the entire magnetosheath.

We demonstrate that the second-order approximation of the Fokker–Planck equation  leads to non-Gaussian kappa distributions of the probability density functions. In all cases in the magnetosheath, the approximate power-law distributions are recovered. For some moderate scales, we have the kappa distributions described by various peaked shapes with heavy tails. In particular, for large values of the kappa parameter this shape is reduced to the normal Gaussian distribution. It is worth noting that for smaller kinetic scales the rescaled distributions exhibit a universal global scale invariance, consistently with the stationary solution of the Fokker–Planck equation.
