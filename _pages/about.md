Welcome to my website! I'm Dariusz Wójcik, a PhD Candidate at the Space Research Centre of Polish Academy of Sciences (CBK PAN) in Warsaw, Poland, working under supervision of Prof. Wiesław M. Macek. My research journey has covered diverse fields, combining mathematics, statistics, physics, and space sciences to tackle complex problems in modern and innovative ways.

I hold B.Sc. in Mathematics (Finances), and two M.Sc.'s in Mathematics in Economy, and Insurance & Finance respectively. However, my academic background spans a wide array of interests, from mathematical modeling in cyber insurance and economics to the study of generalized Lorenz equations in physics. Currently, my focus is on stochastic processes - particularly Markov processes - along with Ordinary and Stochastic Differential Equations, statistical methods, and numerical analysis (using **R**, Python, and Matlab languages). Additionally, I explore fractal and multifractal theory, adding depth to my understanding of dynamic systems.

My research has been published in *The Astrophysical Journal*, and *Physical Review*, among others, and I’ve had the privilege of presenting my findings at international conferences, such as well established *European Geosciences Union*. Since 2022 I’m also actively involved in a National Science Centre project focused on *Turbulence and Magnetic Reconnection in Earth’s Space Environment*.

In recent years, during my PhD course, my work has expanded into the fascinating realms of space science, with a specific interest in *solar wind*, *turbulence*, *space plasmas*, and *kinetic scales*. The interdisciplinary approach allows me to adapt quickly to new research areas, and I’m always excited to take on new challenges. My open-minded attitude toward exploration drives my ability to contribute to collaborative research that crosses traditional boundaries.

On this website, you’ll find a portfolio of my projects, articles exploring given topics, materials related to scientific conferences, and hopefully in the near future my blog where I discuss the latest trends in statistical analysis, AI, and machine learning. When I’m not immersed in mathematics and programming, I enjoy reading psychology books, cooking, playing strategy games, and spending quality time with my family.

I invite you to explore my work, and if you’re interested in collaborating or have any project in mind, **feel free to reach out**. Let’s turn complex challenges into meaningful results. Whether you’re a fellow researcher, a tech enthusiast, or a company in need of innovative solutions, I’m always **open** to connecting with like-minded individuals and exploring new opportunities.
