Welcome to my website! I'm Dariusz Wójcik, a PhD Candidate at the [Space Research Centre of Polish Academy of Sciences](https://cbkpan.pl/en/) (SRC PAS) in [Warsaw](https://www.poland.travel/en/warsaw/), Poland, working under supervision of [Prof. Wiesław M. Macek](http://users.cbk.waw.pl/~macek/). My research journey has covered diverse fields, combining mathematics, statistics, physics, and space sciences to tackle complex problems in modern and innovative ways.

I hold B.Sc. in Mathematics (Finances), and two M.Sc.'s in Mathematics in Economy, and Insurance & Finance respectively. However, my academic background spans a wide array of specializations, from mathematical modeling in cyber insurance ([M.Sc. thesis](https://dwojcik1.github.io/assets/pdf/MSc_PW.pdf)) and economics to the study of generalized Lorenz equations in physics (second [M.Sc. thesis](https://dwojcik1.github.io/assets/pdf/MSc_UKSW.pdf)). Currently, my focus is on stochastic processes - particularly Markov processes - along with Ordinary and Stochastic Differential Equations, statistical methods, and numerical analysis (using [R](https://cran.r-project.org), Python, and Matlab languages). Additionally, I explore fractal and multifractal theory, adding depth to my understanding of dynamic systems.

My research has been published in [The Astrophysical Journal](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0004-637X), and [Physical Review](https://journals.aps.org), among others, and I’ve had the privilege of presenting my findings at various international conferences, e.g., well established [European Geosciences Union](https://www.egu.eu) (see also my Conferences & Projects tab). Since 2022 I’m also actively involved in a [National Science Centre](https://www.ncn.gov.pl/en) (Poland) project focused on *Turbulence and Magnetic Reconnection in Earth’s Space Environment*.

In recent years, during my PhD course, my work has expanded into the fascinating realms of space science, with a specific interest in *solar wind*, *turbulence*, *space plasmas*, and *kinetic scales*. Such interdisciplinary approach throughout the years allows me to adapt quickly to new research areas, and I’m always excited to take on new challenges. My open-minded attitude toward exploration drives my ability to contribute better to collaborative research.

On this website, you’ll find a portfolio of my projects, articles exploring given topics, materials related to scientific conferences and given lectures, and hopefully in the near future my blog where I discuss the latest trends in statistical analysis, AI, machine learning, and cyber security. 
When I’m not immersed in mathematics and programming, I enjoy reading psychology books, cooking, playing strategy games, playing Snooker, and spending quality time with my family.

I invite you to explore my work, and if you’re interested in collaborating or have any project in mind, please feel free to *reach out*, using one of the links (at the bottom of this page). Let’s turn complex challenges into meaningful results. Whether you’re a fellow researcher, PhD Cancdidate, undergraduate student, or a company employee or a manager in need of innovative solutions, I’m always *open to connecting* with like-minded individuals and exploring new opportunities!
