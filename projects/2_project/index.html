It’s what propels us, feeding our questions and inspiring our work. The constant question and answer form a rhythm, a cadence, a story. Science is a story. A story of infinite possibilities. A story of continuous discoveries. A story of hopeful solutions.</p> <p>It’s the story of our journey; we create what’s next. What’s next for our community. What’s next for discoveries. What’s next for our planet. What’s Next for Science.</p> <p>This December 9-14, <a href="https://www.agu.org/annual-meeting" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AGU 2024</a> returns to Washington D.C. with the theme “What’s Next for Science”.
