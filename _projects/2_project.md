Science has always been about the new. The now. The next. It’s what propels us, feeding our questions and inspiring our work. The constant question and answer form a rhythm, a cadence, a story. Science is a story. A story of infinite possibilities. A story of continuous discoveries. A story of hopeful solutions.

It’s the story of our journey; we create what’s next. What’s next for our community. What’s next for discoveries. What’s next for our planet. What’s Next for Science.

This December 9-14, [AGU 2024](https://www.agu.org/annual-meeting) returns to Washington D.C. with the theme “What’s Next for Science”. Excited for the new science and discoveries!
