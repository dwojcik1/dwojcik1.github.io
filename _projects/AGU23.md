The [AGU Chapman Conference 2023](https://www.agu.org/chapman-alfven-waves) international conference aims to bring together scientists to review and discuss the current status of research on Alfvén waves in space plasmas, including the solar atmosphere, the solar wind, planetary magnetospheres and ionospheres, and laboratory plasmas (if relevant to space plasmas). Participants had the opportunity to interact and exchange knowledge and ideas with scientists from various communities in a collegial setting.

The overarching themes of Alfvén wave research, regardless of what system they occur in, are:
- Alfvén wave generation mechanisms
- Alfvén wave propagation and coupling
- Alfvén wave interactions with plasma and energetic particles
- Alfvén wave applications in solar system plasmas
